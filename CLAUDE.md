# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TaskFlow is a to-do application in a kanban board format. This is an early-stage project with minimal setup.

## Project Status

This repository is in its initial stages with only basic project files:
- README.md with project description
- .gitignore configured for Node.js/JavaScript projects
- .vscode settings for development environment

## Technology Stack

Based on the .gitignore file, this project is intended to be a JavaScript/Node.js application. The specific framework and dependencies have not yet been established.

## Development Setup

No package.json or other configuration files exist yet. When setting up the project, consider:
- Choosing a frontend framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- Setting up build tools (Vite, Webpack, etc.)
- Configuring package management (npm, yarn, pnpm)

## Current State

The repository contains no source code yet. Future development will need to:
1. Initialize the project with appropriate package.json
2. Choose and configure the technology stack
3. Set up build and development scripts
4. Implement the kanban board functionality
